/**
 * Provides classes that provide functionality for typed instructions.
 * 
 * Many instructions offer an equal functionality but are used for different types. Instructions for
 * arithmetic operations are an examples. Most of these instructions are available for double,
 * float, integer and long types. Some are available for references and a few also offer direct
 * support for byte, character and short types. In order to have the type specific functionality
 * capsulated, the classes of this package can be used.
